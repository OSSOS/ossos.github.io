<p> You have likely arrived here because you have discovered that an outer Solar System small body is associated
with the <a href="/">OSSOS</a> (or CFEPS) project, and are either seeking more information about that specific object,
or hoping to learn what other objects exist that have the associated data products (of a well-measured, or 
characterized, detection efficiency or are connected to a Survey Simulator).  You can follow the links to the 
<a href="/">OSSOS</a> main pages for more general information about the Survey.
</p>
<p>Many visitors for this page are probably looking for the </p>
<p>MASTER CORRESPONDENCE TABLE</p>
<p>for the OSSOS and CFEPS project, that gives naming linkages between internal names and the Minor Planet Center designations.
(For us, usage of the OSSOS/CFEPS names is useful because
you know the discovery 'block' of sky coverage that the object was found in, along with its depth and search rate characterization.)
The above link will allow you to identify OSSOS+CFEPS internal designations with MPC designations
</p>
<p> In addition, you can here access a </p>
<p> SUMMARY TABLE (ASCII format)</p>
<p> which provides a list of all OSSOS+CFEPS detections, their orbital classification, and their barycentric orbital elements. 
Such a table is best used with the OSSOS Survey Simulator  (MAKE THAT A LINK TO DOCUMENTATION PAGE). </p>
