## Accommodations and Expenses

While the OSSOS team will not be able to assist with any expenses related to your transport to and from Beaune, we have assembled funding that will cover the following expenses for participants:

1. No registration fee, so coffee breaks and meeting room fees are covered. 

2. Hotel accomodation in the conference hotel (prepaid by us) for the nights of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The meeting hotel is the Hostellerie de Bretonniere, on the south edge of the main ring of the old city. Hotel web site here, but participants have no need to contact the hotel as all services are negotiated in bulk. Contact ossoscore if you have any questions or needs. 

3. Hotel accomodation will include breakfast the morning after each night's lodging. Lunch will be provided on Thursday and Friday. (Dinners will not be covered).
