       OSSOS is a survey of the sky using MegaCam on the 3.8-metre Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.<br>
       We aim to discover a thousand distant icy worlds.
</p>
<p>A catalogue of discoveries with photometric and astrometric data will be released to the public via the <a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/">Minor Planet Center</a>.</p>
      <p>OSSOS is currently in discovery phase! Publications are forthcoming.</p>
      <p>Interested? We'd love to have more researchers on board!</p>
