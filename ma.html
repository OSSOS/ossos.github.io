      <h2>The MA blocks </h2>
      <p>As part of the OSSOS ensemble release, one is also able to obtain the 'MA' set of TNOs.
        These TNOs were discovered and tracked as part of the thesis work of Mike Alexandersen,
        which was peformed in a manner similar to OSSOS and CFEPS.  There are two blocks, one
        low-latitude (with object designations malXX where XX is a number) and another high latitude (mahXX).
