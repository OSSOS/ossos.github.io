      <p> You have likely arrived here because you have discovered that an outer Solar System small body is associated
      with the <a href="/about.html">OSSOS</a> (or the earlier <a href="http://www.cfeps.net">CFEPS</a>) project, and are either seeking more information about that specific object,
      or hoping to learn what other objects exist that have the associated data products (of a well-measured, or
      characterized, detection efficiency or are connected to a Survey Simulator).
      </p>
      <p>Many visitors for this page are probably looking for the
       <a href="/OSSOSpublicMaster.txt">OSSOS Master File</a>
        or the
       <a href="/CFEPSpublicMaster.txt">CFEPS Master File</a>, 
      that give the naming linkages between internal project names
        and the Minor Planet Center designations.
        (For us, usage of the OSSOS/CFEPS names is more scientifically valuable because
        then one knows the discovery 'block' of sky coverage that the object was found in, along with its depth and search rate characterization.)
        The above tables will allow you to identify OSSOS+CFEPS internal designations with MPC designations.
      </p>
      <p> In addition, you can here access a
        <b> SUMMARY TABLE (ASCII format, coming mid-May 2016)</b>
        which provides a list of all OSSOS+CFEPS detections, their orbital classification, and their barycentric orbital elements.
        Such a table is, by far, best used in conjunction with the
        <a href="/simulator.html">OSSOS Survey Simulator</a>.
