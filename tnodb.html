      <p>  We present here the public releases of a set of information coming from a set of
        observational surveys, all of which have detailed discovery circumstances measured
        and coupled to the real detections by a Survey Simulator. <p>
      1. The <a href="http://www.cfeps.net">CFEPS</a> Survey (from 2003-2007) was the first large sample of 
         fully tracked and characterized detections. <p>
      2. The pathfinding survey of Alexandersen et al (similar to two OSSOS sky blocks) of 2011-2012. <p>
      3. The  <a href="/about.html">OSSOS</a> Survey from 2013-2018. <p>
      
        The 'ensemble' of these surveys has yielded more than 1000 TNOs inhabiting the outer Solar System, 
      with highly precise orbits, and dynamical classifications.
      Here we provide additonal information about specific objects,
      a complete listing of our discoveries that can be associated to our well-measured, or
      characterized, detection efficiency and modelled using our Survey Simulator.
      </p>
      <p>We provide the 
       <a href="/OSSOSpublicMaster.txt">OSSOS Master File</a> (CURRENTLY E+O blocks) 
TO BO UPDATED)
       and the 
       <a href="/CFEPSpublicMaster.txt">CFEPS Master File</a>, 
      which give the naming linkages between internal project names
        and the Minor Planet Center designations.
        (These linkages to OSSOS/CFEPS names is highly valuable as this provides the link to the 
         'block' of sky coverage in which the object was found.  For each 'block' of sky coverage we provide 
         a precise measurement of our object detection efficency as a function of object brightness and search rate.)
        The above tables identify OSSOS+CFEPS internal designations with MPC designations.
        WE WILL SOON PROVIDE THE 'ENSEMBLE' MASTER FILE WITH ALL OSSOS+MA+CFEPS naming linkages.
      </p>
      <p> In addition the 
        <a href="/CFEPSpublic.detections">CFEPS Summary file</a>
        and the 
        <a href="/OSSOS_EOpublic.detections">OSSOS EOLH Summary file</a> (the publicly available component of OSSOS)
 TO BE UPDATED
         provide lists of all OSSOS+CFEPS detections, their orbital classification, and their barycentric orbital elements.
        Such a table is, by far, best used in conjunction with the
        <a href="/simulator.html">OSSOS Survey Simulator</a>.
