          <h1 id="project_title">OSSOS TNOdb</h1>
          <h2 id="project_tagline">Welcome to the object database.</h2>

<p> You have likely arrived here because you have discovered that an outer Solar System small body is associated
with the <a href="/about.html">OSSOS</a> (or the earlier <a href="http://www.cfeps.net">CFEPS</a>) project, and are either seeking more information about that specific object,
or hoping to learn what other objects exist that have the associated data products (of a well-measured, or 
characterized, detection efficiency or are connected to a Survey Simulator).
</p>
<p>Many visitors for this page are probably looking for the </p>
<p>MASTER CORRESPONDENCE TABLE, coming mid-August 2015</p>
<p>for the OSSOS and CFEPS project, that gives naming linkages between internal names and the Minor Planet Center designations.
(For us, usage of the OSSOS/CFEPS names is better because
you know the discovery 'block' of sky coverage that the object was found in, along with its depth and search rate characterization.)
The above table will allow you to identify OSSOS+CFEPS internal designations with MPC designations.
</p>
<p> In addition, you can here access a </p>
<p> SUMMARY TABLE (ASCII format, coming mid-August 2015)</p>
<p> which provides a list of all OSSOS+CFEPS detections, their orbital classification, and their barycentric orbital elements. 
Such a table is, by far, best used in conjunction with the <a href="/simulator.html">OSSOS Survey Simulator</a>. </p>
