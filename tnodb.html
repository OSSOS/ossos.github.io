      <p>  Nearly 1000 TNOs known to inhabit the outer Solar System have been discovered by 
      <a href="/about.html">OSSOS</a> (or earlier <a href="http://www.cfeps.net">CFEPS</a>). 
      Here we provide additonal information about specific objects,
      a complete listing of our discoveries that can be associated ti our well-measured, or
      characterized, detection efficiency and modelled using our Survey Simulator.
      </p>
      <p>We provide the 
       <a href="/OSSOSpublicMaster.txt">OSSOS Master File</a>
       and the 
       <a href="/CFEPSpublicMaster.txt">CFEPS Master File</a>, 
      which give the naming linkages between internal project names
        and the Minor Planet Center designations.
        (For us, usage of the OSSOS/CFEPS names is more scientifically valuable because
        then one knows the discovery 'block' of sky coverage that the object was found in, along with its depth and search rate characterization.)
        The above tables will allow you to identify OSSOS+CFEPS internal designations with MPC designations.
      </p>
      <p> In addition, you can here access a set of SUMMARY TABLES, for the 
        <a href="/CFEPS.detections">CFEPS Summary file</a>
        and the publically-available portions of OSSOS, in the 
        <a href="/OSSOS_EO.detections">OSSOS E+O Summary file</a>
        which provides a list of all OSSOS+CFEPS detections, their orbital classification, and their barycentric orbital elements.
        Such a table is, by far, best used in conjunction with the
        <a href="/simulator.html">OSSOS Survey Simulator</a>.
