      <p>  Nearly 1000 TNOs known to inhabit the outer Solar System have been discovered by 
      <a href="/about.html">OSSOS</a> (or earlier <a href="http://www.cfeps.net">CFEPS</a>). 
      Here we provide additonal information about specific objects,
      a complete listing of our discoveries that can be associated to our well-measured, or
      characterized, detection efficiency and modelled using our Survey Simulator.
      </p>
      <p>We provide the 
       <a href="/OSSOSpublicMaster.txt">OSSOS Master File</a>
       and the 
       <a href="/CFEPSpublicMaster.txt">CFEPS Master File</a>, 
      which give the naming linkages between internal project names
        and the Minor Planet Center designations.
        (These linkages to OSSOS/CFEPS names is highly valuable as this provides the link to the 
         'block' of sky coverage in which the object was found.  For each 'block' of sky coverage we provide 
         a precise measurement of our object detection efficency as a function of object brightness and search rate.)
        The above tables identify OSSOS+CFEPS internal designations with MPC designations.
      </p>
      <p> In addition the 
        <a href="/CFEPS.detections">CFEPS Summary file</a>
        and the 
        <a href="/OSSOS_EO.detections">OSSOS E+O Summary file</a> (the publicly available component of OSSOS)
         provide lists of all OSSOS+CFEPS detections, their orbital classification, and their barycentric orbital elements.
        Such a table is, by far, best used in conjunction with the
        <a href="/simulator.html">OSSOS Survey Simulator</a>.
