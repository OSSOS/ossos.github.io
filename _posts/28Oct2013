We are trying to acquire observations on a third and fourth discovery patches this month. Ideally we would have acquired those observations last month but the weather refused to cooperate. The moon is not waning and dark sky observing has started in Hawaii, but the fog has clung to the summit. Where are the clear skies that Mauna Kea is so famous for?

On this graph what we are looking for is no bars in the Fog / Precipitation section, clear-skies in the cloud cover (CC), and FWHM < 0.8 in the 'seeing' section. Maybe we'll get something on November 1st.
